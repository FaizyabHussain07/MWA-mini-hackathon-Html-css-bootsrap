## 🚀 Mini Hackathon Challenge – Saylani Full Stack Diploma (Module 1)

As part of **Module 1** of my journey in the **Full Stack Web Development Diploma at Saylani Mass IT Training**, I participated in a **Mini Hackathon** focused on real-world UI implementation skills.

### 🧠 Challenge Overview:
We were given **4 different website references** along with their **Figma designs and live examples**, and were asked to choose **any one** and replicate its **landing page UI** using only:

- HTML5  
- CSS3  
- Bootstrap 5

> ⏱️ Time Limit: **2 hours**  
> ❌ No JavaScript or frameworks allowed – only frontend UI using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap

### 🎯 My Task:
I chose to replicate the **Saylani Welfare Landing Page** and built a complete, **responsive and pixel-perfect clone** of the original design.

### 🛠 Tech Stack:
- Semantic **HTML5**
- Custom **CSS3** for layout & styling tweaks
- **Bootstrap 5** for responsiveness and layout grid
- **Mobile-first** design approach

### 🔥 Key Challenges:
- Designing and coding under strict 2-hour time constraints  
- Maintaining high visual fidelity to the original Web design  
- Achieving responsiveness across screen sizes  
- Using only Bootstrap components without relying on external frameworks

### ✅ Outcome:
Successfully developed a clean, responsive, and design-accurate landing page within the limited time. This project helped sharpen my UI/UX understanding, responsive layout techniques, and speed under pressure.
